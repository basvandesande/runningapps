title: WHAT!? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING! 
description: NO WAY, I HAVE TO PAY TO USE MY OWN DATA? THIS COMPANION APP IS USELESS!

<p>
When I saw the grayed-out feature in the companion app of my treadmill, I was fuming. After uploading my personal run data to the companion app, it turned out that I had to pay to use my own data. 
The expensive high-end treadmill that I bought was basically worthless for my training goal: training for running in the mountains. I am still looking in disbelief at the screen in the app.
</p>
<p>
The frustration I felt, fueled a brief spark of creativity. In my head formed this bold idea: "Why not building my own app? 
The running app of my dreams. An app for runners, built by a runner!" An undertaking that escalated pretty quickly, 
and soon my ideas for the app went beyond my dreams, far beyond my dreams...
</p>
<p>
As a seasoned coding software architect, I have the skills to build this kind of applications. The app may not be perfect, but over the past months it has served me perfectly. Along the way of 
building it, I learned a couple of new tricks. It was a fun journey of creativity. I hope you will enjoy this app as much as I do.

title: 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️ GOT SKILLS? GOT IDEAS?  
description:  LET'S BUILD THIS THING TOGETHER! 
---
  <p>This app started as a wild idea and quickly turned into a full-blown passion project. It’s open source, built with .NET MAUI, and already running on Windows and Android. But I want it everywhere — iOS, macOS, maybe even on a smart fridge someday 😄</p>

  <p>Here’s the catch: I don’t have the Apple gear (or the budget) to tackle that side of things. So if you’re a dev with Apple experience — or just curious to explore — your help would be <em>awesome</em>.</p>

  <p>Whether you want to fork the code, squash a bug, add a feature, or just bark some ideas my way, you’re more than welcome. The GitHub repo is open, the vibe is chill, and every contribution counts — even the tiny ones.</p>

  <p>Let’s make this app smarter, faster, and maybe even more over the top. No gatekeeping. No paywalls. Just runners helping runners. Coders helping coders. And last but not least, a hyperactive beagle supervising the progress.
